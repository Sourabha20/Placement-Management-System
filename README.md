FRONT-END TECHNOLOGY

The text editors that we had used were Notepad++ and Visual Code Studio.Both of these are open-spource softwares that can be downloaded for free on the internet.
  
 Notepad++ latest version download URL :  https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/v7.9.1/      
 Visual Code Studio latest version download URL :  https://code.visualstudio.com/download

The HTML,CSS,PHP codes can be written in these editors and are needed to be saved with .html , .css , .php  extensions respectively.
The HTML files can be opened with any of the browsers(Google,Mozilla Firefox , Microsoft Edge ,Internet Explorer etc..) installed in your laptop. 


BACK-END TECHNOLOGY

1. The back end portion can be built by using some scripting languages like PHP, Ruby, Python, Java with  
     tools like MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server to find, save, or change data and serve it back to the user in front-end code.

    However , the scripting language that we used in our project is PHP and the tool we used is MySQL 
    
2. XAMPP(stands for cross-platform, Apache, MySQL, PHP and Perl) was used for connecting the PHP code and the MySQL database.
    
  XAMPP latest version download URL : https://www.apachefriends.org/xampp-files/8.0.0/xampp-windows-x64-8.0.0-2-VS16-installer.exe

  Whenever you need to use database through your PHP code  XAMPP needs to be downloaded and installed and then all of your  HTML,PHP,JavaScript,CSS,image
  files are needed to be placed in a folder called htdocs within XAMPP. Then you need to start the XAMPP by clicking on the start button or Apache and MySQL in the XAMPP controller.
  Inorder to access the database you need to open your favorite browser and type localhost/phpmyadmin on the search bar.This would lead us to the page where you can create the required database and its tables.
  To access your HTML,PHP files you can search for localhost/htdocs/<your folder name>.
